  |   The demo will showcase the single-player campaign of the              |
  |   twin-stick, third-person action game, including a playable preview    |
  |   of one of the many large-scale boss battles that will be a part of    |
  |   the final version of the game. Players will complete missions,        |
  |   gathering resources to upgrade their guns and body parts to stay      |
  |   alive in the Damned City. If all else fails, players can bring in a   |
  |   friend online to the campaign and mow-down enemies together.          |
  |   Players will also have access to a local couch co-op mode and         |
  |   unique online player-versus-player mode called "Carnage League".      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Featured within the demo is a new gameplay trailer, which will show   |
  |   never-before-seen footage from Contra: Rogue Corps. The demo level    |
  |   is standalone, and progress will not be carried over to the main      |
